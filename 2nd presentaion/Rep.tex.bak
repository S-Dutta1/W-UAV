\begin{itemize}
\item A 2-D model has been developed, this is based on the assumption that the height is constant for all UAVs
\item All UAVs keep monitoring all fires upto a time the 'false alarm' is detected
\item This false alarm is selected randomly and the UAVs adjust their course accordingly
\item Also self collisions among UAVs have been neglected
\end{itemize}
